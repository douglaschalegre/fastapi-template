# About üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

This repository contains a simple API that serves as a kickstart for new projects using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL. It's built with a simple layered architecture, containing domain, service, repository and controller layers. With this layered architecture approach, it's possible to separate concerns and make the codebase more maintainable and scalable.

It's also possible to add more layers if responsibilities grow within a specific layer. That being said, it's important to keep in mind that layers should be as independent as possible, and the dependencies should always point inwards, otherwise, could lead to ciclic dependencies mainly because of Pydantic schemas.

- Main frameworks and packages:
  - [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
  - [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) ([PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database).
